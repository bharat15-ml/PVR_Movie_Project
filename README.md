PVR Movie Dataset - Seat Prediction

This repository contains a dataset of PVR movie theater bookings, designed for building predictive models to estimate the number of seats booked for a given show. The dataset includes features such as movie name, show timing, theater location, past booking trends, day of the week, and special events.

üîπ Key Features:
Historical movie ticket booking data
Factors influencing seat occupancy (e.g., time, location, events)
Suitable for regression and time-series forecasting models
üìå Use this dataset to develop machine learning models for predicting seat availability and optimizing theater occupancy! üé¨üçø

# Challenges Faced
Data Collection ‚Äì High-quality, publicly available data is scarce, requiring significant time and effort for data gathering.

Theatre Data: Indian movie theatre data was fetched using the IMDB API.
IMDB Data: Indian movie datasets were collected via the IMDB API.
Data Quality ‚Äì Theatre-specific data is limited, making it difficult to design a robust business solution. Critical parameters and attributes are either missing or not recorded consistently at a single point in time.

Data Cleaning ‚Äì Due to significant data quality issues, extensive cleaning was required to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Data Exploration & Understanding ‚Äì No single source of truth exists for theatre and movie data, making it challenging to define business problems and solutions. We had to aggregate data from multiple sources to establish a viable use case.

Theatre & IMDB Data Integration ‚Äì Theatre and movie-specific data are not synchronized across sources, making it difficult to join datasets. This lack of alignment complicates the data mining process and hinders the discovery of meaningful patterns.

# Problem Statement
Develop a predictive model to estimate the number of occupied seats in a theatre at any given time based on movie-specific and other relevant features. Using the available data, meaningful features were extracted to enhance prediction accuracy and identify patterns influencing seat occupancy.

# Solution - Probable Approach (Work in Progress)
For predicting the number of occupied seats in a theatre, you can consider the following machine learning models based on the nature of the problem (time-based regression with categorical and numerical features):

1. Regression Models (Baseline & Interpretable Models)
      Linear Regression ‚Äì Simple and interpretable but may not capture complex relationships.
      Ridge/Lasso Regression ‚Äì Helps with feature selection and prevents overfitting.
2. Decision Tree Regressor ‚Äì Captures non-linear relationships but may overfit.
3. Ensemble Models (Better Performance & Generalization)
      Random Forest Regressor ‚Äì Handles categorical and numerical data well; reduces overfitting.
      Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) ‚Äì Models like XGBoost, LightGBM, or CatBoost can effectively capture complex patterns.
4. Time-Series Models (If Sequential Patterns Matter)
      ARIMA/SARIMA ‚Äì If seat occupancy follows seasonal trends.
      LSTM/GRU (Deep Learning) ‚Äì Useful if you have sequential historical booking data and need to model long-term dependencies.
5. Hybrid Approaches
      Combine XGBoost (for feature importance) with LSTM (for time-dependent trends).
      Use Random Forest/XGBoost for initial predictions and fine-tune with Neural Networks for better generalization.
# Recommended Approach: (Continuing...)
      Start with Random Forest/XGBoost for a strong baseline. If sequential trends are important, explore LSTM or SARIMA for better forecasting.
      Linear Regression ‚Äì Simple and interpretable but may not capture complex relationships.
      Decision Tree Regressor ‚Äì Captures non-linear relationships but may overfit.
